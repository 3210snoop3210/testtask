To create an infrastructure diagram highlighting your deployment process, I'll illustrate how your GitLab CI/CD pipeline interacts with AWS infrastructure, Terraform, Docker containers, and related components. Here's a conceptual diagram based on your setup:

AWS Infrastructure Components:

VPC: Includes two subnets (subnet1 and subnet2) in different availability zones.
Security Group: Allows inbound traffic on ports 22, 80, and 8080.
Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Manages the scaling of EC2 instances.
Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes traffic to EC2 instances in the ASG.
Target Group: Associated with the ALB for routing traffic to instances.
GitLab CI/CD Pipeline:

GitLab Runner: Executes pipeline stages using Docker.
Docker-in-Docker (DinD) Service: Provides Docker capabilities within your pipeline.
Pipeline Stages: Specifically, the deploy stage handles Terraform initialization, deployment, and cleanup operations.
Application Deployment:

Docker Compose: Orchestrates containers (app, mysql, redis) defined in docker-compose.yml.
PHP Application: Containerized using a Dockerfile based on php:8.2-fpm, serving PHP applications.
Networking:

Networks: Docker-defined network (my-app-network) connects application containers (app, mysql, redis).
Deployment Workflow:

GitLab CI/CD (gitlab-ci.yml):
Installs necessary tools (terraform, docker-compose).
Sets environment variables (AWS credentials, Docker Hub credentials).
Runs Terraform commands to provision infrastructure (terraform init, terraform apply).
Deploys application using Docker Compose (docker-compose up -d).
Here's a simplified diagram representing your infrastructure and deployment process:

This diagram visually represents how your GitLab CI/CD pipeline orchestrates the deployment of your PHP application using Docker containers on AWS infrastructure managed by Terraform. Each component plays a crucial role in the deployment process, ensuring scalability and reliability.

Key Components:
AWS VPC: Provides isolation for your network resources.
Security Group: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Manages multiple EC2 instances, ensuring availability and scaling based on demand.
Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming traffic across EC2 instances in the ASG.
Target Group: Directs traffic from the ALB to instances based on health checks and routing rules.
EC2 Instances: Managed by the ASG, hosting your application containers.
Subnets: Both public (for ALB) and private (for EC2 instances), spanning multiple availability zones for high availability.
This diagram illustrates how your infrastructure is structured within AWS, ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficient handling of incoming traffic through load balancing and auto-scaling mechanisms. If you need further details or adjustments, feel free to ask!
